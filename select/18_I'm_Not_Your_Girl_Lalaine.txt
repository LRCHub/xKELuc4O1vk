You want a girl who does what's right
The kind who is always there beside you
Someone who is quiet and polite
Like staying home on every friday night

Well that sounds so cute and sweet
But that doesn't do a thing for me

I'm really not that boring
I'm headstrong
And annoying
So I don't see me fitting in your world
I'm noisy and I'm messy
Plus you would never get me
Hey I think you're really hot
But I'm Not Your Girl

So you're into good
And that's too bad
So save your flowers and your poetry
You take a hint
I'll take a cab
You go to bed
I'll find a party

Typical is what your after
Not some beautiful disaster

I'm really not that boring
I'm headstrong
And annoying
So I don't see me fitting in your world
I'm noisy and I'm messy
Plus you would never get me
Hey I think you're really hot
But I'm Not Your... Girl...

That you've been looking for
Boy I'm not the girl next door
Be happy that I'm letting you off easy

Yeah...
Oh... Yeah...

I'm not really that boring
I'm headstrong
And annoying
So I don't see me fitting in your world
I'm noisy and I'm messy
Plus you would never get me
Hey I think you're really hot
But I'm not your girl

(I'm not your girl)
I'm not your girl (I'm not your girl)
I'm not your girl (I'm not your girl)
I'm not your girl (I'm not your girl)

No... No no...
I'm not (I'm not your girl)
Boy you need to see I'm not your girl
