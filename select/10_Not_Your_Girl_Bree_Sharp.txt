I stutter like a broken clutch
When you touch me too much
My tounge gets twisted in your twirl
You say I'm not your kind of girl
A spider underneath my skin
I want you out, I want you in
The venom and the vaccine swirl
You say I'm not your kind of girl

What kind of girl should I be
The kind of girl who doesn't see
That you're looking at me like you
Wanna be seeing someone else
Somebody else

You rip the sureness from my stare
And throw the pieces in the air
Your fingers string me like a pearl
You say I'm not your kind of girl
Its not a secret anymore
What you keep me around for
As my excuses all unfurl
I'm not that kind of kind of girl

What kind of girl should I be
The kind of girl who doesn't see
That you're looking at me like you
Wanna be seeing someone else
Somebody else

See somebody else
See somebody else
See somebody else
(I want you to)
See somebody else
(See somebody)
See somebody else
(I want you to)
See somebody else
(See somebody)
I want you to see somebody else
