Mmmmm (intro)

Do you really think
That you're loving me?
When all i ask is that you show me that you care
Baby cant you see
This love aint meant to be
Cuz when i needed you
You were never there

Im not your girl im not your lover
Just someone thats like no other

All the pain you felt
You see i felt it too
But it was mostly from the trials that you have put me through
Every night and day
I try to find my way
Why you steady thinking ill be yours again one day
You made me promises that you couldnt keep (oh no)
Cuz you were so weak
Since i have set you free
Your wondering
Whos loving me

Im not your girl im not your lover
Just someone thats like no other

(i loved you babaay soo,
Im not your girl, im not your lover,
Cuz youve gone away from me hey yea,
Like no other, i dont wanna fuss and fight
All the tears that i have shed, all the things that you have said
Oh baby)
