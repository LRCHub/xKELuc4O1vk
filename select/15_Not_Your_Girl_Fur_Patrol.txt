So you sail across the ocean
Making plans to meet your family
Clutching packages and photographs
Of those you left behind you
And of those you left behind you
I'm the only one still waiting
For the photographs to find me
And the postcards to remind me

I'm not your girl
I'm not your baby now
This is your world
I did not let you down

So you're locked inside the cardboard
Waiting for the man to find you
You can save me from the sideboard table
Kill the lights to find you
And you still can taste the boredom
Of the days you left behind you
You can hear the indecision
That has followed you halfway across the world

I'm not your baby now
This is your world
I did not let you down
I'm not your girl

I'm not the girl you left behind you
I'm not the flame you held inside you
It's not the world you used to live in
I'm not the one who needs forgiving
I'm not your girl
